## Movie Finder

Web application to obtain movies information, ratings and recommendations

This application looks for a movie and returns its data, ratings from 4 websites calculating the average, and recommendations based on the selection.<br />
The idea of this project was to use hooks and after a review from my part custom hooks were added to separate logic from components.<br />
This project was also used to learn and implement animations using the library Green Sock AP.<br />
Simple routing is used to be able to use forward and backward page navigation.<br />
The project connects to TMDB API as well as connects to IMDB API to obtain the data.<br />

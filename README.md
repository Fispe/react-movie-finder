This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Visit a live version of this application [here](https://fispe.github.io/react-movie-finder/).


This application looks for a movie and returns its data, ratings from 4 websites calculating the average, and recommendations based on the selection.
The idea of this project was to use hooks and after a review from my part custom hooks were added to separate logic from components.
This project was also used to learn and implement animations using the library Green Sock AP
The project connects to TMDB API as well as connects to IMDB API

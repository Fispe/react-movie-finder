Movie Finder

Web application to obtain movies information, ratings and recommendations

This application looks for a movie and returns its data, ratings from 4 websites calculating the average, and recommendations based on the selection.
The idea of this project was to use hooks and after a review from my part custom hooks were added to separate logic from components.
This project was also used to learn and implement animations using the library Green Sock AP.
Simple routing is used to be able to use forward and backward page navigation.
The project connects to TMDB API as well as connects to IMDB API to obtain the data.
